A small prototype to pioneer the use of web-push notifications to iOS and Android devices in my hacker clan.

Apple first announced web-push support for Safari in June 2022[^1], but only added iOS support in March of 2023[^2]. Apple published 
[documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending_web_push_notifications_in_web_apps_safari_and_other_browsers)
on the matter which conforms to web standards[^3].
